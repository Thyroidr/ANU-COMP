# ANU-COMP
## Resources for COMP1130 in the Australian National University

Check out my [A New Student's Guide to ANU COMP1130 (WSL & Haskell)](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1z8fEhqRe1-JdUAPHaNyJ5kUw0Gfb0oFR?usp=sharing) Notebook. 

[Learn you a Haskell for Great Good!](http://learnyouahaskell.com/chapters) is a helpful (and **free**) book. 

The [UPenn CIS194](https://www.seas.upenn.edu/~cis194/spring13/lectures.html) course is also great if you are looking for some problems to work on
